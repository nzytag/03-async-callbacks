#2 The 16-ounce brown bottle pours a turbid, dirty-blonde color, but that's expected as this is unfiltered. Head is a thin white wispy lace that offers little eye candy. The aroma is akin to a traditional Bavarian Hefeweizen with banana and a soft spiciness, but it's far earthier, with burnt sugars at the end, taking on a cidery homebrew/baker's yeast smell as it warms that is none too pleasant. The body is rounded and smooth, but with a tingly carbonation on the palate and an aggressive tartness that breaks things up. Juicy raw apple flavors dominate, along with a sharp Granny Smith bite and rough banana pith. Little sweetness, but fruity at times, and no discerning hop character. Underlying soft and powdery spices. Quite dry overall, and especially in the finish.
